Problem Statement

Takahashi is using a shower at a public bath.
This shower has a button.
If the button is pressed at time t, hot water comes out for K seconds, from time t to time t+K.
Even if the button is pressed again while hot water is coming out, hot water comes out for K seconds from the time the button was last pressed.

There are N Aokis, each of whom presses the button once.
The i-th Aoki presses the button at time A_i.

Find the minimum number of times Takahashi needs to press the button so that hot water is always coming out from time 0 to time T.
Here, hot water is considered to be coming out both at the moment the button is pressed and at the moment exactly K seconds after the last press.

Constraints

- 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5

- 1 \leq K \leq 10^9

- 1 \leq T \leq 10^9

- 0 \leq A_i \leq 10^9

- All input values are integers.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N K T
A_1 A_2 \ldots A_N
```

Output

Print the answer in a single line.

Sample Input 1

```
3 4 20
6 7 12
```

Sample Output 1

```
4
```

If Takahashi presses the button at times 0,2,10,16, hot water is always coming out from time 0 to time 20.

If he presses the button 3 times or fewer, it is impossible to keep hot water always coming out, so the answer is 4.

Sample Input 2

```
9 37 480
12 123 132 213 231 312 321 500 1000
```

Sample Output 2

```
11
```
