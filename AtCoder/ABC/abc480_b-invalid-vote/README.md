Problem Statement

N candidates 1,2,\dots,N are running in an election.
The name of each candidate consists of lowercase English letters, and the names are distinct.
The name of candidate i is S_i.

M ballots 1,2,\dots,M were cast, and ballot j has a string T_j consisting of lowercase English letters written on it.

If there is a candidate whose name exactly matches T_j, that candidate receives 1 vote.
Otherwise, if there is exactly one candidate whose name can be obtained by changing 1 character of T_j, that candidate receives 1 vote.
Otherwise, the ballot is invalid.

For each i=1,2,\dots,N, find how many votes candidate i receives.

Constraints

- 1 \leq N \leq 100

- 1 \leq M \leq 100

- 1 \leq |S_i| \leq 10

- S_i \neq S_j if i \neq j.

- 1 \leq |T_j| \leq 10

- S_i and T_j are strings consisting of lowercase English letters.

- N and M are integers.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N M
S_1
S_2
\vdots
S_N
T_1
T_2
\vdots
T_M
```

Output

Print N lines in total.

The i-th line should contain the number of votes candidate i receives.

Sample Input 1

```
5 8
takahashi
aoki
sato
kato
kano
aoki
takanashi
sano
atcoder
chokudai
kato
aoki
yato
```

Sample Output 1

```
1
2
0
1
0
```

There are 5 candidates: `takahashi`, `aoki`, `sato`, `kato`, and `kano`.

Ballot 1 has `aoki` written on it.

Candidate 2 receives 1 vote.

Ballot 2 has `takanashi` written on it.

Changing the 5-th character from `n` to `h` makes it match the name of candidate 1, and there is no other such candidate, so candidate 1 receives 1 vote.

Ballot 3 has `sano` written on it.

Changing the 3-rd character from `n` to `t` makes it match the name of candidate 3, and changing the 1-st character from `s` to `k` makes it match the name of candidate 5, so this ballot is invalid.
