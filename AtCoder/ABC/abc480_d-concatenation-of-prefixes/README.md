Problem Statement

You are given an integer sequence (A_1,\dots,A_N) of length N.

Construct a sequence B of length \frac{N(N+1)}{2} by the following procedure.

- Initially, let B be an empty sequence.

- For i=1,2,\dots,N in this order, append (A_1,\dots,A_i) to the end of B.

You are given Q queries of the following form; answer them.

Query: You are given L and R. Find B_L+B_{L+1}+\dots+B_R.

Constraints

- 1 \leq N \leq 10^5

- 1 \leq Q \leq 10^5

- -10^8 \leq A_i \leq 10^8

- For each query, 1\leq L\leq R \leq \frac{N(N+1)}{2}.

- All input values are integers.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N Q
A_1 A_2 \dots A_N
\mathrm{query}_1
\mathrm{query}_2
\vdots
\mathrm{query}_Q
```

Here, \mathrm{query}_i represents the i-th query and is given in the following format:

```
L R
```

Output

Print Q lines.

The i-th line should contain the answer to the i-th query.

Sample Input 1

```
4 3
1 10 100 1000
3 6
1 10
8 8
```

Sample Output 1

```
121
1234
10
```

B=(1,1,10,1,10,100,1,10,100,1000).

- The answer to the 1-st query is 10+1+10+100=121.

- The answer to the 2-nd query is 1+1+10+1+10+100+1+10+100+1000=1234.

- The answer to the 3-rd query is 10.

Sample Input 2

```
7 1
100000000 100000000 100000000 100000000 100000000 100000000 100000000
1 28
```

Sample Output 2

```
2800000000
```
